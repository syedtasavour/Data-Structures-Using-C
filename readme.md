## Introduction

This repository covers fundamental concepts of data structures, from arrays and linked lists to advanced structures like trees and graphs. The goal is to provide a solid understanding of how data structures work and how to implement them efficiently in programming. Code examples are provided in C.

## Topics Covered

### UNIT I: Introduction to Data Structures
- **Concept of Structured Data**
  - Understanding data vs. information.
  - Definition and classification of data structures (linear and non-linear).
  - Primitive data types: `int`, `char`, `float`, etc.
  - Control structures: loops and conditionals.
- **Arrays**
  - Basics of 1D & 2D arrays and memory representation.
  - Operations: searching, traversal, insertion, and deletion.

### UNIT II: Sorting and Searching Algorithms
- **Searching Algorithms**
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search (optimized for sorted arrays)
- **Sorting Algorithms**
  - Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort
  - Quick Sort, Merge Sort

### UNIT III: Stacks, Queues, and Linked Lists
- **Stack**
  - LIFO (Last In, First Out) structure, stack operations (push, pop, peek).
  - Array implementation and use cases.
- **Queue**
  - FIFO (First In, First Out) structure, queue operations (enqueue, dequeue).
  - Circular Queue, Deque, Priority Queue, applications.
- **Linked Lists**
  - Singly Linked List, Circular Linked List, Doubly Linked List.
  - Operations: insertion, deletion, traversal.

### UNIT IV: Trees and Graphs
- **Trees**
  - Binary Tree concepts, Binary Search Trees.
  - Tree traversal (pre-order, in-order, post-order) and common operations.
- **Graphs**
  - Basics of graphs, BFS (Breadth-First Search) and DFS (Depth-First Search) algorithms.
